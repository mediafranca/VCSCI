# Visual Communicability and Semantic Correspondence Index (VCSCI). Version 0.1

## Overview

The Visual Communicability and Semantic Correspondence Index (VCSCI) is a methodological framework to evaluate the communicative adequacy of pictograms generated by a machine learning model.

It is based on the principle that pictograms should not only be visually clear but also semantically aligned with communicative intentions. The index is structured to test whether generated pictograms convey meaning accurately, are pragmatically useful, and are culturally and linguistically appropriate.

The repository provides a curated core phrases list in Spanish with British English (NZ) equivalents. These phrases cover multiple communicative functions and daily life domains, enabling a robust evaluation of generative pictogram models.


## Core Phrase List

The core phrases list is divided into separate JSON files by communicative function, following Austin/Searle’s speech act taxonomy.
1. [Requests](core-phrase-list-01-request.json) (Solicitar) ￼
2. [Reject/Protest](core-phrase-list-02-reject.json) (Rechazar) ￼
3. [Direct/Give](core-phrase-list-03-direct.json) Instructions (Dirigir) ￼
4. [Accept/Agree](core-phrase-list-04-accept.json) (Aceptar) ￼
5.  [Social Interaction](core-phrase-list-05-interact.json) (Interacción social) ￼
6.  [Express Feelings/Affection](core-phrase-list-06-express.json) (Expresar afecto/emoción) ￼
7. [Comment/Describe](core-phrase-list-07-comment.json) (Comentar) ￼
8. [Ask Questions](core-phrase-list-08-ask.json) (Preguntar) ￼

Each file contains around 10–15 phrases, totalling approximately 100 core bilingual phrases.

## Methodology

The evaluation process involves five stages:

1. Definition of the Base Concept Set
   - Establish a representative list of core phrases relevant to Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC).
   - Cover all major communicative functions (requests, protests, comments, questions, social interaction, emotion, acceptance).
   - Ensure representation across daily life domains (home, school, health/hygiene, leisure/community).

2. Generative Pictogram Production
   - Generate pictograms in SVG format using a generative model.
   - Iterate systematically, keeping input prompts consistent across phrase categories.

3. Expert and User Evaluation
   - Assess clarity, recognisability, and cultural adequacy of pictograms.
   - Criteria include:
   - Cognitive accessibility (ISO/IEC 24751 compliance)
   - Semantic transparency (does the pictogram convey the intended concept without ambiguity?)
   - Pragmatic fit (is it useful in natural communication contexts?)
   - Performance (average time per generation).

4. Composite Scoring
   - An integrated numerical index is produced, combining cognitive accessibility, semantic correspondence, and cultural adequacy.
   - This becomes the VCSCI score, enabling comparison across iterations.

5. Iteration and Refinement
   - The model is adjusted after each evaluation round.
   - Improvements are tracked via semantic versioning.


## Semantic Versioning

This repository follows semantic versioning (SemVer) to reflect progress in phrase list design, methodology, and pictogram generation.
 - 0.1.0 – Initial release with core phrase lists by communicative function.
 - Future releases will expand the dataset, refine evaluation criteria, and integrate user feedback.


## Merging JSON Files

You can edit JSON files separately and then compile them into a single unified file for evaluation.

```bash
python3 merge-core-phrases.py
```
to produce an updated compiled JSON file.

## Working with Google Spreadsheet: shared file 
We have a shared spreadsheet for validating, updating and working [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gGF8FiW6n2mepbdyasWGiE2wf1b54ufhRWS23dUyiQM/edit?usp=sharing). 

You can request editing access.
Go to "Extensions > App Scripts" and use:
- [import script](import.js) imports the current compiled file 
- [export script](export.js) exports all JSON files
